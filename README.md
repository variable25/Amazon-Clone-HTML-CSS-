# Amazon-Clone(HTML&CSS)
 This project clones the amazon website's front end design using HTML and CSS only. Amazon's layout and color schemes have been modeled and the designed has been worked on solely on the existing website's design, no functionality of the site has been added yet
 No bootstrap element has been used in the implementation of this website's front end. 
 Amazon has it's own fonts and color combinations, so fonts used are closely resembling the one used in the website, but not the actual ones.
